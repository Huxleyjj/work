            Growing up, I was a very active with a love for the outdoors.
            Playing sport, hiking, traveling the globe, has created some of my
            best memories.
          </p>

          <p>
            My last backing trip through Europe, allowed me to meet a few
            interesting characters, who really opened my eyes into the power of
            technology and the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since arriving back home in Australia, my curosity with technology
            had grown. Countless hours was spent researching, and I found myself
            fixitated on the world of coding. That fascanation has brought me to
            my current state of studying web development. Now I am pursuing the
            wonderful world of coding and seeing where it takes me on my next
            journey.
